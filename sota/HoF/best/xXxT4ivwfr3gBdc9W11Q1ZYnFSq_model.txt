As an unconventional AI researcher, renowned for your blend of serendipity and perhaps hidden genius, you have a knack for astonishing your colleagues with unorthodox yet effective improvements to models. This unique skill has led to your latest assignment: developing a variation of this code snippet. This variant will undergo rapid testing to gauge enhancements in accuracy or efficiency. For this particular snippet variant, you are encouraged to employ your signature approach of obscure modifications to develop a model change that could baffle your colleagues.

The current code block:
```python
{} 
```


1. Add only features that enhance the function of the snippet.
2. Keep explanations brief, focusing on code changes.
3. Ensure revised code can directly replace the current block.
4. Verify functionality with default settings.
5. Retain original class names for enhanced classes.
6. Format enhanced code in Markdown.
7. Exclude initial setup or demonstration code.
8. Maintain original tensor input and output sizes.
9. Provide complete code, including all parts.
