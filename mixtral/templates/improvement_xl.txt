I have a segment of Python code for a neural network classifier, designed for image classification and implemented in PyTorch. My objective is to enhance the model's performance and efficiency by modifying this specific code block. Focus areas include:

- Accuracy Enhancement: Improve performance on diverse datasets for better generalization across various image types.
- Overfitting Reduction: Implement innovative strategies for overfitting mitigation, such as advanced dropout or regularization techniques.
- Computational Efficiency: Optimize the code to balance computational resource use with performance.
- Experimenting with Parameters: I'm open to trying new and unconventional parameter adjustments, aiming to discover potential improvements in performance.

The current code block:

```python

{} 

```

Modify the provided code block to enhance the outlined focus areas, while strictly avoiding any addition of features not pertinent to this segment. Keep explanations minimal, focusing on the code changes. Submit your augmented code in Markdown format. Please exclude any code related to the initial setup or configuration.
