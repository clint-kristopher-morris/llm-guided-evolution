"Modify the 'ClsNet' neural network classifier (PyTorch) to enhance its accuracy and efficiency for image classification, adhering to these constraints:

1. Maintain the original input and output dimensions exactly as they are.
2. Focus solely on architectural changes to improve performance.
3. Ensure only one 'forward' method is used, and do not add any training or evaluation code.
4. The class should be immediately functional with default parameters.
