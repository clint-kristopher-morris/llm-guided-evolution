I have a segment of Python code for a neural network classifier, designed for image classification and implemented in PyTorch. My objective is to enhance the model's performance and efficiency by modifying this specific code block. Focus areas include:

- Changing Layers: Explore modifications or adjustments in the neural network layers to enhance model efficiency and accuracy.
- Experimenting with Parameters: I'm open to trying new and unconventional parameter adjustments, aiming to discover potential improvements in performance. I recommend experimenting with non-standard values for default parameters to explore their impact and effectiveness.

The current code block:

```python

{} 

```

Experiment with a distinct and potentially unconventional modification to the current code block. Target improvements in the key focus areas, while strictly avoiding any addition of features not pertinent to this particular code segment. Keep explanations minimal, focusing on the code changes. Submit your augmented code in Markdown format. Please exclude any code related to the initial setup or configuration.
