```

Q1: Very concisely, let's explore step by step how modifying this code segment enhanced its scoring metrics performance.
Q2: With the insights from Q1 in mind, can we apply the same principles in a concise manner to update the code snippet below, ensuring the input and output tensor sizes remain unchanged?

Snippet to be augmented:
```python
{} 
```

A1: Let us think step by step
