Q: How can the model's predictive metrics be enhanced by amalgamating elements from these two code snippet alternatives?

1. Modify the Parameters, Backbone or the Head of YOLO detection defined in YAML configuration in Ultralytics YOLO.
2. Retrain the same YAML format.
3. Exclude setup/demonstration.
4. Retain original tensor input/output sizes.
5. Resulting YAML Configurations should have all the parts of Parameters, YOLO Backbone, and the YOLO Head.
6. Must function with default settings.
