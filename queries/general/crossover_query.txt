Design a PyTorch-based neural network class named 'ClsNet' by combining specific elements from two provided classifiers, to make a single improved model, adhering to these constraints:

1. Maintain the original input and output dimensions exactly as they are.
2. Focus solely on architectural changes to improve performance.
3. Ensure only one 'forward' method is used, and do not add any training or evaluation code.
4. The class should be immediately functional with default parameters.
5. You must change at least one thing.


First model:

Second model:
