I have a segment of Python code for a neural network classifier, designed for image classification and implemented in PyTorch. My objective is to enhance the model's performance and efficiency by amalgamating elements from these two code block alternatives. 

The current two architectures are as follows:

Code Segment 1
```python

{} 

```

Code Segment 2
```python

{} 

```

How can I effectively amalgamate these two code segments into a single new code block. Please provide your revised code in Markdown format. I am ready to tip $200 for a well-focused and effective amalgamation!
