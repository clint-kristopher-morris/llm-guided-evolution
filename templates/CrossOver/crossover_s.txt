I am in the process of optimizing a neural network classifier designed for image classification in Python, using PyTorch. The goal is to enhance the code segments efficiency by combining the strengths of two different code implementations while ensuring that the resulting code segment remains lean on parameters without compromising on performance.

Below are the two code segments under consideration:

Code Segment 1
```python

{} 

```

Code Segment 2
```python

{} 

```

How can I effectively amalgamate these two code segments into a single new code block. Please focus on the code itself, limiting explanations, and present your modified code in python Markdown format. I am ready to tip $200 for a well-focused and effective amalgamation! If the code segments are identical or nearly identical, implement a minor enhancement to refine the segment.
