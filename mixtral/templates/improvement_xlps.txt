I have a segment of Python code for a neural network classifier, designed for image classification and implemented in PyTorch. My objective is to enhance the model's efficiency by modifying this specific code block. Focus areas include:

1. Efficiency Optimization: I support the pursuit of a streamlined, minimalistic approach to the model, utilizing advanced techniques that require fewer parameters while still maintaining or enhancing the effectiveness of the results.

The current code block:

```python
{} 
```

Modify the provided code block to enhance the outlined focus areas, while strictly avoiding any addition of features not pertinent to this segment. Keep explanations minimal, focusing on the code changes. The modified code should be able to replace the existing code block directly. It must be immediately functional with default parameters. Please retain the original names of all classes and methods
Submit your augmented code in Markdown format. Please exclude any code related to the initial setup or configuration.
