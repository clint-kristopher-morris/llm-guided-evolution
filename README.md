## Introduction

In the ever-evolving domain of machine learning, the convergence of human cognitive skills and automated algorithms is entering a pivotal junction. This paper introduces “Guided Evolution” (GE), a novel framework that combines the human-like expertise of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the robust capabilities of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) through genetic algorithms. This innovative fusion advances automated machine learning, elevating traditional NAS by integrating a more insightful, intelligently guided evolutionary process.

Central to this framework is our  “Evolution of Thought” (EoT) technique, which extends and refines concepts like Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought, Automated Chain-of-Thought, and Tree-of-Thought ([1], [2], [3]). These methodologies aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. EoT takes a unique step forward by enabling LLMs to receive result-driven feedback, empowering them to make informed improvements based on the performance of their prior code augmentations, a significant advancement in intelligent automated machine learning.

EoT catalyzes LLMs to introspect and fine-tune suggestions based on past iterations, creating a self-enhancing feedback loop that fine-tunes architectural evolution. This process maintains essential genetic diversity for evolutionary algorithms and injects a level of creativity and human-like expertise into the evolutionary framework. Building from the insights of Ma et al. [4], our Guided Evolutionary framework is further enhanced by a Character Role Play technique, to markedly increase the feasibility, usefulness and creativity of ideas engendered from the LLM. 

The efficacy of the GE framework is exemplified in the evolution of the ExquisiteNetV2 model. This case study illustrates the framework's autonomous ability to generate improved model variants, emphasizing the burgeoning impact of LLMs in redefining traditional model design pipelines, a step towards to models that independently evolve and refine their architectures.
